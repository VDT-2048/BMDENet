# BMDENet
We proposed a bi-directional modality difference elimination network (BMDENet) to boost the segmentation performance. Concretely, the bi-directional modality difference elimination module (BMDEM) reduces the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal images in the prototype space. The residual attention fusion module (RAFM) mines the bimodal features to fully fuse the cross-modal information. In addition, the mainstay and subsidiary enhancement module (MSEM) enhances the fusion features for the existing problem of the advanced model. Extensive experiments on Tokyo Multi-Spectral-4i dataset prove that BMDENet achieves the state-of-the-art on both 1- and 5-shot settings.
